# About the Company

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for
women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the
potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market.
Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes
that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth
opportunities for the company.

#### Services offered by Bellabeat

1.  Bellabeat app: The Bellabeat app provides users with health data
    related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and
    mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their
    current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app
    connects to their line of smart wellness products.
2.  Leaf: Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a
    bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects to the
    Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.
3.  Time: This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic
    timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and
    stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you
    with insights into your daily wellness.
4.  Spring: This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using
    smart technology to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated
    throughout the day. The Spring bottle connects to the Bellabeat app
    to track your hydration levels.
5.  Bellabeat membership: Bellabeat also offers a subscription-based
    membership program for users. Membership gives users 24/7 access to
    fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health
    and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.

**The dataset provided is not representative of all the services offered
by Bellabeat devices and is limited in its scope. However, it will help
us gain an understanding of features that promote active use of similar
devices and guide marketing and product designing strategies for
Bellabeat.**

These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via
Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible
Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data,
including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and
sleep monitoring. Limitations such as the size of data sample and the
fact that not knowing key information such as participants’ demographic
characteristics, lifestyle, time location, weather indicators, activity
tracker usage , unfortunately, would limit the scope of analysis that
can be performed.

\# Questions for Analysis: 1. What are some trends in smart device
usage? 2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? 3. How
could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## Business Task:

### Identify potential opportunities for growth and recommendations for the Bellabeat marketing strategy improvement based on trends in smart device usage.

This project will analyze FitBit Fitness Tracker Data available on
[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/data). Through
the analysis of this open source data, we can get insights into factors
influencing the usage of such fitness tracking devices which can help
our stakeholders design new devices or update existing devices
accordingly.

### Approach

Initially, I will do EDA to observe any trends, patterns and
associations between variables. Since we have dates for when the data
was collected, the number of days will account for higher or lower usage
of fitness devices.

The main focus will be on what features are used the most.

For the purpose of this analysis, I will be focusing on hourly data and
disregarding the minute level data.

In the analysis, the datasets provided by Bellabeat were structured such
that each record was associated with a unique identifier (ID), serving
as the primary key. This consistent use of IDs across all datasets
enabled seamless merging of data, ensuring that information from
different tables could be accurately linked. By using this primary key,
we combined the datasets to create a comprehensive dataset, facilitating
analysis across variables such as user activity, sleep patterns, and
device usage.

## Cleaning the Data

First, we will begin by cleaning and formatting the datasets.

``` r
# Checking if the data contains any missing values

sum(is.na(daily_activity))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(is.na(hourly_calories))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(is.na(hourly_intensities))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(is.na(hourly_steps))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(is.na(sleep_day))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(is.na(heart_rate))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
sum(is.na(weightLog))
```

    ## [1] 65

As we can see there are 65 missing values in the weightLog dataset,
however, further analysis reveals we won’t be using this dataset,
therefore, these values are not replaced.

Starting by cleaning the column names

``` r
daily <- daily_activity %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(daily_activity$ActivityDate), day_week=weekdays(date)) %>%
  select(1,16,17,3,15,4,11:14)

head(daily)
```

provided a clear understanding of the shared and unique users across
datasets, helping to assess data completeness and consistency. By
identifying the intersections, we could focus on the subset of data that
included common users, ensuring robust and comparable analyses

``` r
identical(unique(daily$id),unique(hourly_activity$id)) #it shows that ids for hourly acitivty and daily acitivty are same and hence the daily activity data is a generalized summary of the hourly recorded data

As we can see, there are only 3 Ids using all four features.

### Single-feature records or users:

18% (6 Ids) have only STEPS count records (no other features being used)

### Duo-feature users:

27% (9 Ids) have only duo-feature of STEPS - SLEEP records (This
subgroup is the closest one to that of Bellabeat’s Leaf users as purely
recorded Steps - Sleep)

1 id has only the duo feature of STEPS - WEIGHT record

1 id has duo feature of STEPS - HEARTRATE record

### Trio_feature users:

27% (9 ids) used 3 features of STEPS - SLEEP - HEARTRATE

9% (3 ids) used 3 features of STEPS - SLEEP - WEIGHT

1 id used trio-feature STEPS - HEARTRATE - WEIGHT

Since the dataframe closest to the BellaBeat device is too small (only 9
Ids), we will be using the Sleep-Step Dataset, who may or may not be
using other features.

As part of the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA), density plots
were created. These plots provide a visual representation of the
distribution of each variable, allowing us to identify patterns,
skewness, and potential outliers in the data. By examining the density
curves, we gained insights into the central tendencies and spread of
user behaviors, such as activity levels and sleep patterns.

``` r
step_sleep_lf <- step_sleep %>%
  select(-c(id,date,day_week, total_sleep_records)) %>%

The “Total steps” variable shows a peak with the majority of the
distribution concentrated in the middle, while a few values extend into
the right tail. This indicates that the data points are not normally
distributed. Additionally, the plot reveals a few extreme values on the
lower right end, which could suggest measurement errors (e.g., false
steps recorded due to wrist movements) or instances when users engaged
in extra exercise on those particular days.

The “Very active minutes” and “Fairly active minutes” variables are
positively skewed, with most data points clustered on the left side,
primarily around zero. This could indicate a technical error, such as
the device not syncing with the user’s phone app—a common tracking issue
reported in the Fitbit Community. Alternatively, it could mean that
users did not engage in any exercise on those days. There are also a few
outliers on the right, with values exceeding 100 minutes.

To analyze user engagement trends over time, a heatmap in the form of a
calendar was created to display the number of active users per day. This
visualization provides a clear, intuitive view of activity patterns,
highlighting peaks and troughs in user engagement.

``` r
# Get number of users used their devices each day:
no_users <- step_sleep %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(user_perday = sum(n()), .groups = "drop")
#Plot a calendar heat map on total steps by day
calendarPlot(no_users, pollutant = "user_perday",year=2016, month = 1:5, main = "Number of Users by Day", cols="heat", key.header = "Number of Users", key.position = "top")
```

``` r
options(repr.plot.width = 14, repr.plot.height = 10) 
```

The visualization shows the 30 days the data is collected, days with
darker colors indicate more users tracked data on that day whereas
lighter color indicates less tracked data. Highest number of data was
collected on April 15 whereas the least was collected on May 12.

### Creating Subsets based on activity level

``` r
obs_days <- step_sleep %>% group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise(num_dayuse = sum(n())) %>%
  arrange(-num_dayuse)


# Dividing ids into different usage categories  
usage <- obs_days %>% 
  mutate(group = case_when(
    between(num_dayuse, 1, 10) ~ "Low Usage",
    between(num_dayuse, 11, 20) ~ "Medium Usage",
    between(num_dayuse, 21, 31) ~ "High Usage",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
    ))

# df with new usage classification 
usage_df <- step_sleep %>% 
  left_join(usage, by = "id")

sum_usage <- usage %>% 
  mutate(group = fct_relevel(group, c("High Usage", "Medium Usage", "Low Usage"))) %>% 
  group_by(group) %>%  
  summarise(num_users = n()) %>%  #counting each observation vs sum is used to aggregate
  mutate(percent = num_users/sum(num_users)*100)


colors <- brewer.pal(length(sum_usage$group), "Set2")

# Create a 3D pie chart
pie3D(
  x = sum_usage$num_users,
  labels = paste0(sum_usage$percent, "%"),
  explode = 0.05 ,   # Adds space between slices
  main = "Usage Distribution",
  col = colors,
  labelcex = 0.8,  # Adjust label size
  radius = 1,  # Adjust radius size
  start = 0.9
  )

par(xpd = TRUE)  # Allow plotting outside the plot area
legend("topright", legend = sum_usage$group, fill = colors, bty = "n", cex = 0.8)
```

![](FitBit_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- --> As we can
see majority of users are high users whereas medium usage lowers are the
least.

To segment users based on their engagement with the fitness device,
usage frequency was categorized into three groups: high, medium, and low
users. High users were defined as those who used the device for at least
21 days in a month. Medium users were those with 11 to 20 days of usage,
while low users were classified as those who used the device for fewer
than 10 days in a month. This classification provided a clear framework
for understanding user engagement levels and allowed for targeted
analysis of behavior patterns across these segments.

Creating a dataframe with data for each user of three usage levels for
each day:

``` r
usage_hr <- usage_df %>% group_by(group, date, id, day_week) %>% 
  mutate(total_mins = sum(very_active_minutes, fairly_active_minutes, lightly_active_minutes, total_time_in_bed)) %>%   
  summarise(steps = round(mean(total_steps),0),
            distance = round(mean(total_distance),0),
    very_active = round(mean(very_active_minutes),0),
            fairly_active = round(mean(fairly_active_minutes),0),
            lightly_active = round(mean(lightly_active_minutes),0),
            sedentary_hr = round(mean(sedentary_minutes)/60,2), #dividing by 60 since we data in minutes and converting to hr
            bed_hr = round(mean(total_time_in_bed)/60,2),
            asleep_hr = round(mean(total_minutes_asleep)/60,2),
            avg_hr = round(sum(very_active, fairly_active, lightly_active, sedentary_minutes, total_time_in_bed/60,2)))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'group', 'date', 'id'. You can override
    ## using the `.groups` argument.

This creates our main dataset, that is divided into: 1. usage levels 2.

Although each ID may appear multiple times across different days due to
repeated usage of the device, the dataset contains a total of 24 unique

multiple entries for the same user, providing a detailed record of their
daily interactions with the fitness device.

-High Usage group tends to have the highest number of steps taken
consistently throughout the week, with a preference for evening steps.
Majority of the steps were taken in the evening hours ie between 5:00 to
8:00 pm. The second most active time of the day was around lunch.

-For low usage group, there was no consistent routine in walking, there
were some days with very high number of steps like saturday evening and
wednesday night but there was no pattern.

-Medium usage group do walk daily but the time of the day is not
consistent, it varies from morning to evening, with least amount of
steps at night.

-In all groups, Saturday and Monday evening seems to be the most active
duration where most steps are recorded.

For the users with the least recorded data, higher number of steps is
associated with rigorous forms of activity and most calories are burnt
when distance is higher, implying longer duration of intense exercise.

## Discussion

Though our data set was limited, it gave us some useful insights about
consumer usage of fitness devices. The given users were divided into 3
categories based off the number of days they wore devices:

**-High Usage (21-30 Days)**:

    Since these users wore their devices the most, it can be presumed that they are health conscious and have tendency to record their daily activities. They are likely diligent about syncing their data regularly. These are the everyday users who follow a clear and consistent schedule to achieve their daily goals.
      
      **Weekly Schedule**: The group tends to have a consistent schedule throughout the week, inclduing weekends where during morning, afternoon and evening, some physical activity is recorded, with evening having the most active time of the day. Their sleeping patterns are also fairly consistent and they get around 8 hours of sleep daily. 
      
      **Exercise Type**: These users tend to engage in all kinds of physical activites throughout the day, and remain fairly more active even during working hours. Most of the calories burned by users in this group came from vigorous exercises. Similarly, the majority of steps were accumulated during exercises of high or moderate intensity. However, the number of calories burned is not necessarily proportional to the number of steps taken, suggesting that frequent users may have engaged in other forms of physical activity.
      

**-Medium Usage (11-20 Days)**:

    These users wore their devices for lesser number of days, implying that they are interested in being more health conscious but can lack motivation to be consistent. They exercised less compared to the other two groups, these participants took fewer steps during weekdays and compensated for this on weekends. While their hourly step pattern may be somewhat similar to the high usage group, their activity levels remained much less intense, even lower than those in the low usage group.

    **Weekly Schedule**: There seems to be no consistent pattern in the form or schedule of phyiscal activity followed by this group but they recorded sufficient time spent in bed and asleep hours. Most of the activity is spent in lesser intensities such as commuitng and shopping, whereas time recorded for higher intesnity levels is very low. Compared to high intensity group, not much activity is observed during evening, higher intensity levels are recorded on weekends, specially Saturday.

    **Exercise Type**: Lighter forms of activity are more prevelant in this group, for example: commuting between places or shopping, where they spend most of their time.

**-Low Usage (0-10 Days)**:

    Though the group had the least amount of recorded data, it was observed that whenever possible the users kept themselves active, they are flexible in their timings and schedule.

    ** Weekly Schedule**: The group does not have a concsitent pattern of workout but Saturday seems to be the most active day. The users tend to spend a lot of time in bed, even when they are not asleep. The group also has the most number of outliers in terms of minutes in different activity levels, indicating that these users might be more active but are not recording their activities. 

    **Exercise Type**: Higher calories are burnt in higher intensity exercises with higher number of steps, indicating that they might be engaging in intense walking activities. 

## Limitations

1.  Small Dataset: The dataset provided is very small, and the sample
    similar to Bellabeat users is even smaller, limiting the
    generalization of the observations.

<!-- -->

1.  Technical issues:50% of the users did not use their device or
    tracked their data for the whole month which furhter limits the
    analysis.

2.  Lack of Background Information: The data has been collected
    anonymously and there is no information provided about the
    participants like their sex, occupation, age which can severely
    impact the data and hence, it limits the scope of application.

## Recommendations

1.  Increasing Product Integration:

    It is important to make the customers more interested in the product
    and fitness. Fitness devices are common to own but very few actually
    utilize them due to the lack of information about their features and
    benefits.

    Therefore, a mobile-based application which provides insight on the
    features available and shares real-time feedback, by comparing
    activity on active days, can work as a motivational factor to help
    users.

2.  Convenient Product Usage:

The product can be integrated with a mobile application which can record
steps, even when someone forgets the fitness tracker at home. As seen in
the low usage users, there might be chances of users simply not using
the fitness tracker, therefore applications recording steps can serve as
motivation to use the device which will provide more insights. The app
can also track water consumption, weight and calories consumed, further
integrating it into overall health score for a day.

3.  Customized Notifications:

Through the app, users can be reminded about working out, depending on
the time of the day when they workout; They can also be notified about
bed time. Furthermore, users can indicate whether they want to loose
weight or build muscle, and health notifications with food and workout
ideas can be shared with the user.

4.  Targeting the Interested Population:

Health conscious people are more likely to record their activities and
engage with the app, therefore it can be promoted to already active
people like hikers, cyclists or other athletes.

To attract new customers, promotions can be made inside gyms or
nutritional websites.

5.  Rewards and Sharing:

To make the experience more rewarding, a badge system can be offered in
the app, where users earn badges for hitting certain milestones.
Further, sharing updates with family or friends can also serve as a
motivational factor.
